## Contributing

The Go+ project welcomes all contributors. We appreciate your help!

Here are [list of Go+ Contributors](https://github.com/goplus/gop/wiki/Goplus-Contributors). We award an email account (XXX@goplus.org) for every contributor. And we suggest you commit code by using this email account:

```bash
git config --global user.email XXX@goplus.org
```

If you did this, remember to add your `XXX@goplus.org` email to https://github.com/settings/emails.

What does `a contributor to Go+` mean? You must meet one of the following conditions:
